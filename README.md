CareerMap is a career exploration and guidance project designed to help users understand different career paths, required skills, and possible learning routes. The project focuses on making career data easy to explore through a clean, interactive frontend experience.

CareerMap compiles structured career-related data and presents it in a user-friendly interface. The goal is to help users:
- Explore career options

## 🤖 Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI played a key role in this project by helping to:
- Research and compile career data from multiple knowledge sources
- Structure raw information into readable and usable datasets
- Identify common skills, tools, and progression paths across careers
- Speed up data organization and validation

Rather than replacing development work, AI was used as a **productivity and research assistant**, allowing faster iteration and more accurate data compilation.


## 🎨 Frontend Development

I used my frontend development skills to:
- Design and build an intuitive user interface

- Improve readability and navigation using structured layouts
- Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes

The frontend acts as a visual layer that transforms raw career data into an accessible and engaging experience for users.
